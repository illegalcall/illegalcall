- Integrated **Chainlink oracles** to minimize Loss-Versus-Rebalancing (LVR) for liquidity providers
- Contributed to backend microservices powering the decentralized exchange using **Node.js, Kafka, Rust, and Docker**


## Open-Source Contributions

### [Rig](https://github.com/0xPlaygrounds/rig) — Rust LLM Agent Framework
Added optional model overrides and LLM-based skills for improved agent ergonomics.

### [Agave](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave) — Solana Validator Client
Contributed performance tuning, ABI compatibility, feature flags, and test migrations across the validator stack.

### [Noir](https://github.com/noir-lang/noir) — ZK Proof DSL
Improved compiler errors and fixed-size array methods.

### [Solana Kit](https://github.com/anza-xyz/kit) — Official Solana JS SDK
